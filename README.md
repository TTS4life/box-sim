# Box Simulator

A very simple Black Ops 1 Box simulator. Currently configured for the map Ascension. This simulator makes a few assumptions:
- That the player starts with nothing from the box
- That the player ditches the Thunder Gun immediately after receiving it.

  This then outputs the data into a .csv file containing the number trial run and the number of TGuns received in that game.
  This script is currently configured to also assume you have Mule Kick, but you can change that as you see fit.
